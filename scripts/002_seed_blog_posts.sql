  '5 Essential BJJ Techniques Every Beginner Should Master',
  'essential-bjj-techniques-beginners',
  'Master these fundamental Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques to build a solid foundation for your grappling journey.',
  'Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is known as the "gentle art," but mastering it requires dedication to fundamental techniques. Here are five essential moves every beginner should focus on.

## 1. The Shrimp (Hip Escape)

This fundamental movement is the foundation of defensive BJJ. The shrimp allows you to create space, escape bad positions, and set up your own attacks.

## 2. Bridge and Roll Escape

When mounted, the bridge and roll is your primary escape. This technique uses leverage and timing rather than strength, embodying BJJ''s core principles.

## 3. Closed Guard

Learning to control an opponent from your back is crucial. The closed guard is both defensive and offensive, allowing you to sweep or submit from bottom position.

## 4. Rear Naked Choke

One of the most effective submissions in all of martial arts. This technique is high-percentage and can end a match quickly when applied correctly.

## 5. Armbar from Guard

A fundamental submission that teaches you to control limbs and use leverage. The armbar from guard is a gateway to understanding BJJ''s submission system.
